# SAP-AI-Staff-Optimizer
SAP GenAI-powered Event based Hotel Staffing and Price Optimizer(prototype)

SAP Luxury Hotel Optimizer
A demonstration of how a luxury hotel chain can leverage SAP's AI capabilities to optimize pricing and staffing operations across properties in multiple countries.

Overview
This project simulates how a hotel chain with 300 properties could use SAP Business AI to dynamically adjust room pricing and optimize staffing based on real-time market conditions. The solution analyzes booking trends, local events, and competitor rates to deliver data-driven recommendations.

Important Note: This is a simulation created for portfolio purposes. It uses mock data and simulates SAP's AI capabilities without connecting to actual SAP services. In a real implementation, this solution would integrate with various SAP technologies as described below.

Key Features
AI-Driven Dynamic Pricing: Calculates optimal room rates based on multiple factors:

Local events (conferences, festivals, sports)

Seasonal demand patterns

Competitor pricing

Luxury rating of the property

Historical booking trends

Intelligent Staffing Optimization:

Department-level staffing recommendations (front desk, housekeeping, restaurant, etc.)

Adjustments based on occupancy, events, and weekends

Labor cost calculations and forecasting

Staff allocation optimization for service quality

7-Day Forecasting: Projects pricing and staffing needs for the upcoming week

Event Impact Analysis: Shows how local events influence pricing and staffing decisions

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes recommendations with explanation of contributing factors

SAP Technologies (Simulated)
In a real-world implementation, this solution would integrate with:

SAP AI Core
The application simulates how SAP AI Core would host and manage machine learning models for:

Price elasticity prediction

Demand forecasting

Staffing optimization

Event impact analysis

These models would continuously learn from outcomes, improving recommendations over time.

SAP Generative AI Hub
The natural language explanations in the application demonstrate how SAP's Generative AI Hub would:

Generate human-readable explanations for pricing decisions

Provide rationale for staffing recommendations

Create insights from market and booking data

SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)
The architecture simulates how the solution would be deployed on SAP BTP, which would provide:

Scalable infrastructure for processing hotel chain data

Integration capabilities with existing systems

Security and compliance features

API management for data connections

Integration with SAP S/4HANA
In production, this solution would connect to:

SAP S/4HANA for financial data and bookings

SAP SuccessFactors for workforce management

SAP Customer Experience solutions for guest data

Technical Details

Pricing Factors
- The pricing engine calculates optimal room rates using these factors:
- Season Factor: Adjusts prices based on seasonal demand
- Demand Factor: Reflects current booking trends
- Event Factor: Increases rates during local events
- Competitor Factor: Adjusts based on competitive landscape
- Luxury Factor: Accounts for hotel rating and quality

Staffing Factors
The staffing engine optimizes labor allocation based on:

- Occupancy Factor: Adjusts staffing based on projected occupancy
- Event Factor: Increases staffing during local events
- Weekend Factor: Accounts for typically higher weekend demands
- Seasonal Factor: Adjusts for seasonal variations in service needs

Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AxelSuffrin/SAP-Luxury-Hotel-Optimizer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd SAP-Luxury-Hotel-Optimizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
Usage
After starting the application, navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the dashboard. From there you can:

- View hotels with upcoming events using the "Hotels With Events" feature
- Explore dynamic pricing recommendations for specific properties
- Review staffing plans optimized based on occupancy and events
- See how different factors influence both pricing and staffing decisions

This project was developed as a portfolio demonstration of how SAP AI technologies could be applied in the hospitality industry. It uses:

- Python Flask for the backend
- Bootstrap for responsive UI
- JavaScript for interactive features
- Simulated AI for pricing and staffing algorithms

In a real implementation, these would be replaced with connections to actual SAP services and APIs.
